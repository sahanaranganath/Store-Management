# Store-Management

Online Store Management System Project in PHP is a web-based application developed 
for serving shopping centers, shopping malls, etc. As the project title implies, the main 
aim of this project is to create a platform for online shopping. After the implementation of 
this project, customers can choose and order the desired products from anywhere with 
internet access. The project promotes e-commerce and growing trade competition in the 
market.

Nowadays, almost all people are busy with their own works or business. They don’t even 
have time to go to the market for shopping. Although they are in the need of something, 
they can’t go to shopping centers due to shortage of time. The exiting traditional system of 
shopping has a large number of drawbacks such as time-consuming procedure, formation 
of crowd in malls, problem of bargaining, etc. These problems waste time of customers 
and manpower of businessmen or entrepreneur. Keeping these things in mind, 
businessmen started the process of e-commerce.
In order to shop using Online Store Management system, the website of shopping center 
that has installed this system needs to be logged on. After that, you can see a large number 
of items on your browser window. In this system of shopping, below each items its price 
and other necessary data or information are tagged. If you want to buy any item, click at 
the item and read more about it. Then, you should confirm your purchase by payments. 
Within a certain time your purchased item is delivered at your door.
